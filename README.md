# :wave: Hello! I'm Simone

I am a Project Director who has recently trained as a Full Stack Developer. 

Previously, I led a department where I managed large-scale campaigns generating over a million in annual revenue and led a team of 12. This background in project management and creative problem-solving fueled my transition to tech.

My journey into coding began out of a natural curiosity and a deep-seated interest in technology, prompting me to complete a Full Stack Engineering Bootcamp in early 2024. Beyond coding, I'm an avid learner, diving into podcasts, YouTube videos, and online courses on a variety of topicsâ€”from investing and emerging technologies to history and neuroplasticity. Most recently, I finished a course on AI through Codecademy and Udacity.

Learning is more than just a hobby for me; it's a passion that continuously drives me to explore and grow. Here on GitHub, you'll find projects that showcase my skills, interests, and my commitment to continuous learning and improvement. I am always eager to incorporate new technologies and insights into my work, constantly seeking new avenues of knowledge and growth.
